This is completion data stolen from the atom ecosystem, namely:

https://github.com/dapetcu21/atom-autocomplete-lua
https://github.com/rm-code/love-atom

Since luarocks is pretty bad about resolving data files we convert them to a
lua-based format automatically. see lua-lsp/data/generate_files.lua for more.
